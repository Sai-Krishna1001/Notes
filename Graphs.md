# 📈 Graph Data Structure Notes 📊
### 💡 Introduction
#### A graph is a data structure that consists of:

    A finite set of vertices also called nodes. 🗺️
    
    A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge. ➡️ The pair indicates that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v. 🏹

#### Graphs are used to represent:

    Networks 🧵
    
    Social networks 👥
    
    Circuit networks ⚡
    
    And so on!

### 📍 Types of Graphs
#### Directed/Undirected

    Undirected Graph - The edges have no particular direction. ↔️
    
    Directed Graph - Edges have a particular direction associated. ➡️
    
#### Weighted/Unweighted

    Weighted Graph - Edges have weights assigned. 🏋️‍♀️
    Unweighted Graph - No weights assigned to edges.
    
#### Cyclic/Acyclic

    Cyclic Graph - Contains cycles. 🔁
    Acyclic Graph - No cycles. 🔀
    
### 🗺️ Graph Representation

    Adjacency Matrix - 2D V x V array containing edges. ⬜⬜⬜
    Adjacency List - Array of lists denoting outgoing edges. 📃

### 🔎 Graph Traversal

    Depth First Search - Goes deeper first. 📉
    Breadth First Search - Level by level traversal. ➡️

### 🧠 Advanced Algorithms
    Dijkstra's Algorithm - Shortest Path 🚘
    A* Search - Heuristic based Shortest Path 💡
    Prim's & Kruskal's - Minimum Spanning Tree 🌲
    Topological Sort - Scheduling Order 📆
